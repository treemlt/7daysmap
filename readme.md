**:blue_book: Installing Tree Gaming's Latest Map in 7 Days To Die**

Follow these steps to add the current map to your game:

---

**:one: Locate Your Game Folder :open_file_folder:**

Default Steam path:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die
```

*If you installed Steam elsewhere, navigate to that location.*

---

**:two: Open the Worlds Directory :mag:**

Navigate to:
```
7 Days To Die → Data → Worlds
```

---

**:three: Download the Map :globe_with_meridians:**

:inbox_tray: [Download the latest map](https://github.com/treemlt/7daysmap/releases/download/latest-map/treeworld.zip)

---

**:four: Extract the Archive :compression:**

1. Install [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0) or another .rar extractor  
2. Right-click the `.zip` or `.rar` file → **Extract to `treeworld\`**  
3. You’ll get a folder named `treeworld` with the map folder inside.

---

**:five: Install the Map :inbox_tray:**

Copy or move the map folder inside **`treeworld`** to:

```
...\7 Days To Die\Data\Worlds\
```

It should now look like:
```
...\Worlds\MAPNAME\prefabs.xml, spawnpoints.xml, etc.
```

> ⚠️ **Do NOT place the `treeworld` folder itself inside the Worlds folder.**  
> You must move the actual map folder *inside* `treeworld`.

---

**:six: Launch the Game :arrow_forward:**

- Start or restart **7 Days To Die**

---

:white_check_mark: **Enjoy the new map!**  
If something doesn’t work:
- Make sure the folder structure is correct  
- Ensure you’re running the right game version

:zombie: Happy surviving!
